            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a software application that creates, and manages records or revisions on changes to a file or a group of files. VCS software can be very useful for developers who like to have multiple versions of a project in an accessible format, who are working collaboratively, or if they have plans of distributing their software in an open-source license. Without these VCS applications like Git, developers would have to manually backup their source code every time they make revisions to their files. Also, collaboration between multiple people can be a hassle when you have to keep track of multiple versions of the same file while developing the app or project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one example a version control system, or an application that aids in the creation and maintenance of multiple versions of a file or a group of files. Unlike other VCS applications that view multiple files as a list of data and the times when the data was modified, Git views the data behind each revision of a project as a snapshot as a whole. This can be beneficial for those who are working on group projects. This is because Git can better distinguish changes made by each user and therefore can guide a user on how to resolve conflicting revisions when necessary. For other VCS applications, a revision made by one user can completely overwrite the changes made by another person.  Git’s snapshot based view along with its distributed version control model allow it to excel in ways other VCS products struggle.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems exist in two main forms: distributed and centralized. A distributed VCS is a system that allows a user to have a group of directories that are on the host’s computer (local repository) and on a separate server (remote repository). A distributed VCS provides each user a local repository that they can individually edit and eventually push those changes to the remote repository. This can be useful in cases where one user’s push of files to server overwrites the files of another user. If the user who initiated the push made a mistake, then the other user can roll back the changes with ease.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A centralized Version Control System on the other hand only involves a single centralized repository where all changes are made. In this case, the user would access the remote repository and make edits on the files directly as opposed to editing files on a local repository. Centralized repositories were very simple to use; however, their functionality was very limited. Users would have a hard time making branches if they wanted to due to the nature of a centralized system. A good analogy to a centralized VCS would be a book in a library. A person can check one out, read it for a while, check it back in so that another person can use it. The downside with this approach is that other users would have to wait until the first user checks in their book in order to read it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With both distributed and centralized VCS, a user would be interacting with a remote repository or a collection of various versions of a project stored on a separate server. The presence of these remote repositories are crucial for the collaboration process to work. A user can have multiple remote repositories for various projects with numerous collaborators. In the case of distributed version control systems, once a person is completed with a section of their project, they would “push” their changes to the remote repository through a command. Later, another user can pull the changes made to the remote repository to their local repository through a “pull” command.</p>
